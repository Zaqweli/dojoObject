    # Worms Arena

Two worms fight into an arena : there can be only one !

Each worm has a name, life and attack points. [ok]

When a fight begins, each worm attack in turn, until one of them doesn't have any life point : life remaining is equals to current life point minus adversary attack.

The rules stipulate that each turn, the worms with the lowest life points attacks first. If equal, the worm in first argument begins.

Return the name of the victorious worm !

You'll have to complete both `Worm` and `Arena` classes.

> The arena only accepts worms with valid name, life and attack points : no need to check !
